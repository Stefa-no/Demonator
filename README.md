# AR-Invaders
An open source game recreating the beloved classic "Space Invaders" in the real world! Shoot aliens and fight for the safety of our world right from the comfort of your own room.

This is meant to be an educational repo as well as a project that is always a communal work in progress. Feel free to take a look at the code (which is well commented), and add to it yourself! If your changes are well tested and work, we'll merge your pull request with the main branch and push it with the next update to the App Store :)
